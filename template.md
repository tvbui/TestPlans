- Configs required from app, infrastructure, etc

## Risks / Mitigation                                                            
- Things causing tests to either not be executable/fail                          
- Call outs for things thats that can take too much time, or not be automated    

## Entry Criteria
### Functional Tests
- Things required for functional tests to start or be executed
### Integration Tests
- Things required for integration tests to start or be executed
- Some things include components ready, or having specific things set per integration

## Exit Criteria
### Functional Tests
- requirements for exit in functional tests
- test passes, metrics updated, etc
### Integration Tests
- requirements for exit in integration tests
- revert environment back to original state
